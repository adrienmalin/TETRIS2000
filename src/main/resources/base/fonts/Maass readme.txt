This Font I created for the world leader in salmon slicing machines: Maass Salmon Slicers. It was inspired by their logo.

Update Notice: Jan.2007:  I have removed the Maass-Logos, cause the company asked me to do this. And as I had to edit the font, I have added a lot of more glyphs: 
I have addes lowercase letters, the complete set of european "Latin Extended A" glyphs fpr all the west and east european languages,
greek glyphs as well as kyrillic letters, including special letters for other countries than russia using kyrillic writing.
